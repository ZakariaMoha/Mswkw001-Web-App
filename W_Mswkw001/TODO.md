# Upload Timeout Fix TODO

- [x] Analyze upload error and identify causes (timeout due to Cloudinary upload duration)
- [x] Modify src/utils/cloudinary.ts to accept MIME type for base64 upload
- [x] Update app/api/upload/route.ts to pass file.type to uploadImage
- [x] Add 30-second timeout wrapper around uploadImage call in route.ts
- [x] Update error handling in route.ts to return 408 for timeout errors
- [ ] Test the upload functionality to ensure timeout is resolved
- [ ] Verify that different image formats (PNG, JPEG, etc.) upload correctly
